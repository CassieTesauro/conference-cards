# Overview
This CRUD application was inspired by the countless hours teachers spend gathering and organizing student data.  With Conference Cards, teachers can view and manage data for their students in one spot.  Conference Cards has an accessible, easy-to-navigate layout that is intuitive for teachers with limited computer skills and limited time. After logging in, teachers can select a student from their roster in order to vew, edit, or delete their data card.  Teachers can also create cards for new students.
